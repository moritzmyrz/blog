# Maximizing Your Azure Investment: Tips and Best Practices

## Introduction

Most businesses are looking to optimize their Azure investment, but they don’t know where to start. This article will walk you through some tips and best practices that will help your business save money on Azure.

## Leverage free training resources

Azure has a lot of free training resources. It also has a lot of free resources for your test environment and development projects, including the following:

* Azure credits to get you started with your first application in minutes
    
* Free SQL Database Developer subscriptions that provide 1 TB of storage and up to 1 million rows per table
    
* Free managed services such as Cosmos DB, Log Analytics, and Application Insights
    

## Automate deployments with templates and scripts

If you have a large number of instances to manage, or if you're deploying similar applications across different environments, templates can be an excellent way to automate deployments. You can use them to deploy one or more instances (or groups) of the same application. Templates also allow you to specify specific settings for each instance that are deployed using the template.

If you want to save yourself time and effort by automating your deployment process as much as possible, consider creating templates that represent different types of servers within your environment — for example, web servers or database servers — and use these in conjunction with scripts that perform manual tasks such as assigning DNS names and configuring server roles. This allows for greater flexibility when scaling up an application's infrastructure over time because it eliminates many manual processes; however, this does mean that it may require more technical knowledge than some other methods discussed heretofore.

## Understand what you are getting for your money

For example, if you are looking to host a website on Azure, you can choose from several different SKUs that provide varying levels of computing, memory, and storage capabilities. If your website is not very popular or does not generate a lot of traffic, then using the free tier will be sufficient to get it up and running. But if your site attracts millions of visitors daily, then you'll need to consider upgrading your subscription plan before things start breaking down due to increased load.

Understanding what each Azure SKU provides is important because it helps determine whether or not the package fits within your budget while also ensuring that the infrastructure has enough resources available for whatever workloads need to be hosted there.

## Design for performance and availability

For example, if a system has multiple nodes that are required 24/7 (such as an e-commerce website), then the design should protect against failures of individual nodes by using replicas or replication so that there is always one copy available at all times. This can increase costs because more resources are being used and might also limit performance due to I/O contention on read replicas or other bottlenecks in the system. By contrast, if an application doesn't need high availability but does require very fast speeds (for example video streaming), then replicating data across multiple regions might be more expensive than just buying a machine with more RAM or CPU cores in each region where most of your customers live; however this may result in better overall user experience since users won't see any lag when accessing content from any location where they live (even though some replicas may not be used).

For designers to make these decisions correctly (and ultimately drive down costs), they must first understand what requirements their applications have so they can make informed choices about how best to implement them efficiently while still meeting those needs.

## Leverage fault domains for cloud resiliency

Fault domains are a way to isolate failures. If an entire fault domain goes down, you can continue to operate in another, so your application or service will continue to be available despite hardware failure. You can use fault domains for various purposes: for instance, you can group virtual machines into multiple fault domains based on their physical location (such as in different availability zones). This strategy helps protect against hardware failures by isolating individual failure scenarios by holding a limited number of resources (VM instances) within each fault domain.

## Deploy your application to multiple regions within an Azure region group

To maximize your Azure investment, you can deploy your application to multiple regions within an Azure region group. You can use this capability for disaster recovery, high availability, and business continuity.

## Monitor resource utilization and costs in detail, including tags.

When you're using Azure, it's important to monitor resource utilization and costs in detail. Monitoring should be done in real-time, across all resources and regions, for cost, performance, and availability. Here are some tips:

* Use tags to track what you spend your money on. Tags are available for the following services: App Services (web apps & mobile apps), virtual machines (VM), storage accounts, databases & SQL Databases, Cosmos DB & Geode databases. You can add up to 50 tags per resource type; each tag has a maximum length of 512 characters.
    
* Use tag expressions when assigning multiple values from another field to a single tag value so that you can see how much each resource is costing across different teams or business units within an organization.
    

## Use auto-scaling to scale out or in based on application demand

Autoscaling can be used to scale out or in based on application demand. For example, you can use autoscaling to reduce costs by stopping and starting virtual machines (VMs) based on your application’s usage patterns. This is especially useful, for example at night when there is less activity.

In addition, autoscaling allows you to automatically add more VMs when your application requires additional capacity. For example, if all the VMs are busy processing incoming requests, then Azure will automatically deploy new instances of VMs as the load requires.

## Take advantage of Azure’s per-minute billing granularity to reduce costs during off hours

You can reduce your Azure bill by taking advantage of per-minute billing granularity. Per-minute billing allows you to define and specify the exact amount of time that should be billed for each virtual machine instance that runs on Azure instances, which means you only pay for what gets used.

For example, if the VM is running but you have no users connected to it and no website on it for some time (at night or on weekends), then those costs will be zeroed out and won’t even show up in your monthly invoice. This can save significant amounts of money if applied correctly, especially when combined with other cost optimization techniques like spot pricing discounts or reserved instances as described above!

## Shut down dev/test environments to save money during off hours

You may be surprised to learn that shutting down dev/test environments during off hours can save money. Dev/test environments are often used for development and testing, but not production. They are typically not necessary 24 hours a day, seven days a week, so it makes sense to shut them down when they’re not in use. This can help lower your Azure bill by as much as 80%.

Shutting down dev/test environments is easy. All you need to do is create an automation rule that shuts them off every night at midnight local time and then turns them back on again at 6 am local time each morning of the following day (and repeat). If you happen to work for another business during the day, then this might mean adding an extra hour or two so your rules don't turn on the environment too early or late in the morning—but it's still relatively simple!

## Conclusion

We know that most companies start their journey with Azure by leveraging free resources and learning. Once you’ve built up a solid foundation, you can start looking at templates, scripts, and other automation tools to help improve your deployment process. We also recommend automating as much monitoring as possible to ensure the high availability and performance of your applications running in Azure.
