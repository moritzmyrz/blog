# Creating a Cohesive Brand Identity Through Web Design

## Introduction

Companies that want to create a cohesive brand identity and develop an emotional connection with their customers must pay attention to the details. The reason why some brands can do this is that they understand how the human mind works. They know that if you can connect with your audience on an emotional level, then you will be able to gain credibility and trust in less time than ever before.

## Start with your logo.

Your logo is the first thing people will see when visiting your website. It's what they associate with your brand, so it's essential to have one that is clear and easy to recognize, timeless, and not trendy.

## Don't just make it blend in; make it stand out!

A cohesive brand identity is a powerful tool that can help you communicate your business idea quickly and effectively to potential clients. A solid visual identity will also help your customers remember who you are and why they should trust you with their business. It's essential to remember that designing a cohesive brand identity doesn't just mean making sure the colours work together—it means making sure all parts of your company's appearance work together.

Your website is one of the first things people see when they visit your site, so it needs to look good right off the bat by establishing a clear visual style that matches what people expect from your business (i.e., if you're an accounting firm, don't make it look like an entertainment agency). The fonts, layout options, and colour scheme should all be consistent throughout all aspects of design: social media profiles, marketing materials like brochures or flyers, and even press releases announcing new services!

## Explore new fonts

* Make sure the font is readable.
    
* Make sure it fits with your brand's theme.
    
* Don't use too many fonts at once; this can be distracting for users and will take away from your brand identity.
    

## Create a colour palette.

Now that you have your logo and tagline, it's time to decide on a colour palette. Asking yourself these questions can help:

* What personality do I want my brand to have?
    
* How will this impact my target audience?
    
* What emotions do I want to evoke when people visit my website or read about my business?
    

It's essential that the colours you choose say something, whether lighthearted or severe and bold. It would be best to consider which colours are most visible when viewed on different devices—it may be easier to read black text on a white background. Still, if your customers use mobile phones regularly while looking at your site, they may struggle with reading this interface. And remember that contrast matters; if your website has two blocks of text written in black with white backgrounds, they'll probably blend without standing out enough for viewers to notice them well enough!

## Develop a style guide.

A style guide is the bible of your brand's identity. It's a document that lays out all the details of using your logo and other branding elements, from the colour palette to typography. A good style guide is comprehensive but not overwhelming—it helps you keep track of every aspect as it changes in size or colour so that nothing looks off when it appears on different media types.

It's also important to note that creating a cohesive website design isn't just about choosing fonts and colours; it also involves deciding how much white space there should be between text blocks, where navigation options will appear on pages, etc.—all things you'll find in a well-designed style guide.

## Incorporate your brand identity into your layouts.

* The consistency of your brand identity and its use throughout your website is the key to creating a cohesive and memorable experience for your visitors. If you want them to feel like they're visiting one company, not just a series of websites that may or may not be associated with each other, then you need to make sure that everything about how your website looks feels like it belongs together.
    
* Do this by using similar colours and fonts throughout the design, incorporating similar images into different areas of content (like headers), and keeping layouts consistent from page to page (i.e., if all pages have white backgrounds but some have blue titles while others have green ones), or using similar styles in terms of layout or formatting (such as paragraph length).
    

## Define your brand's personality.

Next, you need to define your brand's personality. This is an essential step in the process because it will establish the tone of your business and help guide all future design decisions.

A company's personality plays a significant role in building customer trust, so it should be reflected in every aspect of its presentation—from product packaging to website copywriting to social media posts.

Take Coca-Cola, for example; the soda giant has a distinct personality that can be felt across nearly all of its marketing materials (which likely informs why people are willing to spend $1 billion per year on Coke). Coca-Cola is colourful and fun but also approachable and trustworthy. It's not just about selling soda; it becomes part of people's lives by bringing joy into their homes through advertisements that strive to remind viewers that "every day brings something new."

## Get inspired

As you begin to think about your brand identity, make sure to collect a variety of references. Look at websites and brands that have already established their visual language. An excellent place to start is the internet itself! Try looking at other websites that use a similar colour scheme or style guide as your own. You can also look at designs from well-established brands like Apple, Coca-Cola, and Nike. These companies have built their identities over decades and have become household names because of it—their logos are instantly recognizable worldwide.

You might also want to visit with friends or family members who work in graphic design; they may give you some insight into how they approach projects similar to yours or share resources with you so that you can continue learning about branding yourself!

## Find your visual identity.

Your brand's visual identity is how you want to be perceived and the first thing people see. This means that the visual identity needs to be cohesive, consistent, and complete across all platforms.

To create a cohesive visual identity, you need to decide what message you want your company to convey. For example, if you are selling luxury products, your website must have an elegant feel with high-quality images and fonts; if you're selling cheap items like clothing, then it would be better if they were bright, colourful, and vibrant.

## Find the right colour pallet.

Colour is essential to creating a cohesive brand identity, so it's vital to ensure that your colour palette complements the rest of your branding.

To choose a colour palette, you should start with the basics: red and blue are complementary colours, which means they work well together, while green and yellow are complementary. You can also use tertiary colours—those that sit between two primary colours on the colour wheel—and split them into two sets (e.g., blue/orange, red/green).

The most common mistake businesses make when choosing their web design colours is using too many different shades of one colour; instead of appearing stylish or fun, this will appear cluttered and unprofessional at best! If you're going to use multiple shades of one hue in your website's branding (which we recommend), stick with no more than three different tints or tones in total; this helps create balance without overwhelming users with too much information all at once.

## A cohesive brand identity is critical for businesses that want to gain credibility, trust, and revenue.

A cohesive brand identity is critical for businesses that want to gain credibility, trust, and revenue. When you have a strong brand identity, you'll be able to stand out from your competition.

It would be best to remember that having a compelling brand identity can help you build customer trust. This is because they will be able to recognize your company's visual elements when they see them elsewhere on various devices and platforms. This includes social media posts or website design elements (like buttons).

In addition to building trust with customers through consistency across platforms and mediums, having a cohesive brand identity can also help increase revenue for your business! By creating an adequate visual language for all of your marketing materials—including logos, websites, and social media accounts—you are better able to differentiate yourself from competitors because these elements will create a consistent look which makes it easier for people who see them repeatedly over time remember what your company stands for.

## Your company's story should be evident through and through!

We've already talked about the importance of your brand being authentic. But what does it mean to be accurate? And how can you ensure that your website is as consistent with your brand identity?

It means reflecting your values in everything you do. It means not just saying them but living them every day. It means ensuring that everything in and around your business reflects those values—that includes the website!

For people to remember something and feel like they know who you are, it has to be something they can relate to in some way. Remember when we talked about creating an emotional connection? This is important in creating a cohesive brand identity through web design!
