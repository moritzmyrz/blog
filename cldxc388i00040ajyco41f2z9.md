# Unveiling the Pros and Cons: Website Builder vs Custom Code - Which One Reigns Supreme?

## Introduction

To create a website for your business, you must decide whether to use a website builder or write custom code. While both options have pros and cons, several factors can help guide your decision.

## Benefits of using a website builder

One of the most significant benefits of using a website builder is the ease of use, which means you can get your site up and running in no time. The drag-and-drop interface allows you to add content without knowledge of code or HTML. You need to drag the items you want onto their corresponding sections, such as text boxes for text entries or images for photos.

Website builders are also cost-effective because they allow you to create your website without paying a developer's salary. Plus, many of these services offer free trials to try them out before committing yourself.

Another benefit is design flexibility: website builders usually have hundreds of templates, so there's no shortage when selecting one that matches their brand identity best! However, this may be negative if you want a unique look on your website.

## Drawbacks of using a website builder

Drawbacks of using a website builder:

* Design limitations. Most website builders have limited design options. For example, they usually don't allow you to customize the color scheme or fonts. In addition, some website builders are better than others at handling responsive design (a technique that makes websites look good on different screen sizes). If you have specific design requirements and want complete control over your site's appearance and operation, consider hiring an experienced web designer instead of using a DIY tool like Wix or Squarespace.
    
* Scalability issues. Many small businesses start with just one product or service but grow into more extensive operations over time as they add additional products/services and staff members who need access to company resources such as calendars, email accounts, etcetera - and this can become difficult if your initial choice wasn't built with scalability in mind because most do not offer features such as multiple user logins or file-sharing capabilities between team members until after purchase which means they could end up costing more money later down the road when trying to fix these problems yourself using custom code instead.
    

## Benefits of writing custom code

You may wonder, "What can I do with custom code that a website builder won't let me do?" There are many benefits to using custom code over a website builder.

First, it gives you more flexibility and customization options. For example, you can create any page layout you want--from a simple blog post to an eCommerce store - and customize it however you'd like. You also have complete control over how the site functions, which means that if there's something about your site that isn't working quite right yet or isn't working at all (like broken links), then fixing this issue will be easier since it's not something built into the platform itself but rather part of your customizations.

Second, writing custom-coded solutions usually gives websites better performance and load times than if built in WordPress or another CMS (content management system). This is because these platforms rely heavily on plugins and themes; at the same time, these tools can provide valuable features such as image galleries and contact forms, they often come at the cost of loading speed due to heavy processing requirements needed for each new feature added onto them by developers who build them after-market rather than having been developed during development time itself.

## Drawbacks of writing custom code

While a custom-coded website has many benefits, it also has some drawbacks.

* Building a website from scratch requires more technical knowledge and expertise than building a website builder.
    
* Website builders are typically cheaper than hiring developers or designers to create custom code for your business's online presence--and if you're not sure whether or not you'll need all of those bells and whistles, then building with one could save money by allowing some flexibility later on down the line when growth plans change unexpectedly!
    

## Conclusion

With all of this information in mind, it's clear that there are advantages and disadvantages to both methods. Website builders offer a quick, easy way to create a website that looks professional without writing code. However, they don't allow as much customization or flexibility as custom coding does - and even then, if you want something unique or different from what's out there already (like an entirely new type of website), you'll probably need some help from experts!
